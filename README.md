(I recommend breadboarding it first)

For the Arduino code, you'll need the BLE_MIDI library: https://github.com/lathoub/Arduino-BLE-MIDI

I never made a schematic, but as long as you know how to wire buttons and switches you should be good. The only other wiring is for the accelerometer, which goes directly from the X and Y pins of the accelerometer to any analog pins on the ESP32.

Here's a pretty picture of it, though:

Here's a video showing how to use the glove: https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6u06UhuX4E

I should note this glove is a slightly different version that includes a light sensor (photocell).
