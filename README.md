For the Arduino code, you'll need the BLE_MIDI library: https://github.com/lathoub/Arduino-BLE-MIDI

I never made a schematic, but as long as you know how to wire buttons and switches you should be good. The only other wiring is for the accelerometer, which goes directly from the X and Y pins of the accelerometer to any analog pins on the ESP32.

Here's a pretty picture of it, though:
